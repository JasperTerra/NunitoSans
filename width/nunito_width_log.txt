NUNITO NOTES:

Overshoots Basefile:
	ExtraLight = 8
	Heavy = 12

Overshoots WDTH
	Set to 12 in all masters, from here we can judge if Condensed and Expanded need more or less overshoot.

General:
	Point structure; how do we convert to TT? For example on width axis; when conversion is done inside FL, point structure of actual TT outlines might differ between Condensed and Extended (because curves are wider), not sure how this is done is GA but I think through terminal it is possible to control how conversion is done.

Stems (vertical of /n):
	Normal width ExtraLight 42, Heavy 208

Width and Weight:
	Condensed 		81%
		ExtraLight	-8 and wider spacing				34
		Heavy		-22									186
	Extended 		125%
		ExtraLight	+2									44
		Heavy		+16 and more narrow word space		224

LOG:

NunitoSans_BaseFile_WDTH_03
	Adjusted outlines in the new masters (Condensed and Expanded) of ExtraLight (‘OHhamburgefontsiv’). Made proofs using the adjusted glyphs. For the Condensed ExtraLight +18 tracking was added in InDesign as test to determine overall colour next to normal width ExtraLight and Expanded ExtraLight.


NunitoSans_BaseFile_WDTH_02
	Same as WDTH_01 version, but with masters for Condensed and Expanded created scaled and stems adjusted) and set up (Axes Coordinates (stem values), Weight and Width, weightClass parameters). Neither spacing (Condensed ExtraLight) nor outlines/advance widths have been touched.


NunitoSans_BaseFile_WDTH_01
	This is the same as the base file (NunitoSans_BaseFile_05.glyphs.zip) but with bracket layers removed. 
	The glyphs on bracket layer 200 were added to the 208 Heavy master (so those optical corrections are in); these are marked red.
	The glyphs on bracket layer 177 were added to the 178 Black instance by implementing a custom parameter (renaming, thus swapping them in instances) to Black and Heavy. For this purpose alternates of the following glyphs were made (.black). The origals of these are marked green, the alternates are marked dark green. The rule contains the following:
		Property
			Rename Glyphs
		Value
			a.black=a
			ae.black=ae
			eth.black=eth
			e.black=e
			schwa.black=schwa
			gstroke.black=gstroke
			oe.black=oe
			ordfeminine.black=ordfeminine
			ordmasculine.black=ordmasculine
			Haabkhasian-cy.black=Haabkhasian-cy
			ve-cy.black=ve-cy
			sha-cy.black=sha-cy
			shcha-cy.black=shcha-cy
			softsign-cy.black=softsign-cy
			hardsign-cy.black=hardsign-cy
			yeru-cy.black=yeru-cy
			nje-cy.black=nje-cy
			ia-cy.black=ia-cy
			yusbig-cy.black=yusbig-cy
